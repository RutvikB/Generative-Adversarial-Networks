# Generative-Adversarial-Networks using TensorFlow 2.15.0

<b> What are GANs? <br> </b>
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the most interesting ideas in computer science today. Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. <br> A generator ("the artist") learns to create images that look real, while a discriminator ("the art critic") learns to tell real images apart from fakes.

This repo demonstrates the process of building two GAN models using the [MNIST](https://keras.io/api/datasets/mnist/) dataset. <be>
1. Simple GAN using a simpler Convolutional and Fully Connected Layers
2. Deep Convolutional GAN with a more complex architecture

   
We use Google Colab to train models quickly, and using its GPU backend (if we're lucky! ðŸ¤ž) <br>

## Generator
- Uses `tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose` (upsampling) layers to produce an image from a seed (random noise)
- Start with a Dense layer that takes this seed as input, then upsample several times until you reach the desired image size of `28x28x1`
- `LeakyReLU` activation is used for each layer, except the output layer which uses `tanh`

## Discriminator
- Basically a CNN-based image classifier outputting real vs fake probabilities

## Training Process
- Generator receives random seed input
- Seed produces a "noisy" image
- Discriminator is used to classify images as Real (Images taken from train set -> Positively High Output Probability) or Fake (Images generated by Generator -> Negatively Low Output Probability)
- Loss is calculated using custom functions for both models
- Gradients are calculated and used to update the generator and discriminator models
